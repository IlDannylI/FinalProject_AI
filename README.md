# BREAST CANCER IMAGE SEGMENTATION USING CONTRAST METHOD APPROACH W/DEEPLABS_V3RESNET-50  
## Created by Angel & Danny (Kean University)

### About

**This is a ipynb file of our group final project for CPS Course 4801. That focuses on using the model "deeplabs_v3resnet-50" alongside the contrast method to do image segmentation. 
This study focuses on using image segmentation to classify breast cancer images using a contrast method approach with deeplabs_v3 that specifically uses resnet-50 as its backbone. The dataset used is from Kaggle, a popular dataset sourcing webpage. The dataset selected consisted of a total of 1,578 images and 2 classes (Benign & Malignant). The reason for utilizing this dataset is because of the structured classes and clear images, ready to use and implement into a model.**
