# BREAST CANCER IMAGE SEGMENTATION USING CONTRAST METHOD APPROACH W/DEEPLABS_V3RESNET-50  
## Created by Angel & Danny (Kean University)


### About

**This is a ipynb file of our group final project for CPS Course 4801. That focuses on using the model "deeplabs_v3resnet-50" alongside the contrast method to do image segmentation. 
This study focuses on using image segmentation to classify breast cancer images using a contrast method approach with deeplabs_v3 that specifically uses resnet-50 as its backbone. The dataset used is from Kaggle, a popular dataset sourcing webpage. The dataset selected consisted of a total of 1,578 images and 2 classes (Benign & Malignant). The reason for utilizing this dataset is because of the structured classes and clear images, ready to use and implement into a model.**


### Deeplabsv3_resnet-50 Model

**DeepLabv3 is a Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture for Semantic Segmentation Tasks. It uses Atrous (Dilated) Convolutions to control the receptive field and feature map resolutions without increasing the total number of parameters. Another main attribute is something called Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling which effectively extracts multi-scale features that contain useful information for segmentation. In general, the network is able to capture dense feature maps with rich long-range information that can be used to accurately segment images.**
